The user is prompted to enter either "Odd" or "Even". The user then inputs a number between 1 and 6. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 6. The sum of the user's number and the computer's number is calculated. If the sum is odd and the user chose "Odd", the user also wins the toss and is prompted to choose between "Bat" or "Ball".
